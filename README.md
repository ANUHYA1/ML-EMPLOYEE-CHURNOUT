# ML-EMPLOYEE-CHURNOUT
The challenge was to conclude the factors affecting employee turnover on a simulated company using various exploratory data analysis techniques and statistical testing. 
• Deduced from various graphs and a correlation matrix that employee satisfaction, evaluation, average monthly hours, and project count were leading factors in turnover. 
• Understood the importance of using a ROC graph to measure precision/recall rates for class imbalances to evaluate model performance rather than accuracy.

Solution :
1. Conducted Exploratory Data Analytics from finding correlations, statistical T-test across predicting variables leading to employees leaving the Company
2. Developed Machine Learning Predictive models using Decision Trees, Random Forest, kNN, SVM, Naive Bayes, Logistic Regression, Adaboost, Gradient Boosting Classifiers [sklearn] to predict the possible turnover of employees, the best of which predicted with 0.99 ROC AUC
